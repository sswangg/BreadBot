There was a strategy to make profit from betting so I made it so that if you won a bet, you'd get 20%-180% of the betting amount back, if you lose the bet however, you lose 100% of the betting amount
**4/1/21**
Instead of making the among of grain you get from winning a bet 20%-180%, I changed it to 20%-100%, however the chance to win the bet is now 60%. Also, the amount you lose when betting is 100%. Also added 9 more cards

Rewriting code (actually this time)
**11/23/2021**
Removed Trade and Quest commands, since they were poorly designed but got a lot of commands to work with cogs. I will try to simplify the code even more later so it's more effective.

Thanks to Saph#6803, the code is now a lot more clean
